# SCP - Containment Breach in Godot 4+

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/),
and intended to become a remake of the original SCP: Containment Breach.

# Requirements:
â€¢	Godot 4.2.1 (at the moment. The intention is to update with the engine)

"Beware - the source code is perhaps more horrifying than the game itself!" is a quote from the original repo. So let's hope we can fix that again :)

The idea is to incrementally update and translate the code into GDScript (strictly typed) to stay as close to the original as possible, and write a few converters for the original assets. The assets can and will be improved, as I intend to rework the whole visuals to be more modern than the original, partly to show off Godot's new rendering capabilities. Maps will be broken down (as assets like benches are baked into the maps and such). Textures can be AI upscaled or made from scratch if someone is up for the challenge (cuz I'm not).

Remember, this is a remake, not a whole overhaul... unless the changes are definitely needed for a more fun gaming experience.

Let's see how long it takes to get a running version.
